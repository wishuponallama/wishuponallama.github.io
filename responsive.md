# Responsive

How to make website responsive?

* Media queries
    * breakpoints related to the most common device resolutions: 480px, 768px, 1024px, 1366px.
* Change units from absolute ones (px) to relative ones (rem, vh, vw)
    * rem: unit sets the font size relative to the root container
    * vw: unit sets the font size relative to the percentage width of the website itself
* Use flex and grid
* Use browserstack to check responsiveness
